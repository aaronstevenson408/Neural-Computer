# Neural-Computer
trying to make models of the different logic gates so that we can create a Turing complete computer, each one of the pipeline steps should be its own function or class. all functions should be generic enough to take in class variables from different model classes 

## Pipeline Outline

### Dataset Generation
- [ ] Generate datasets for different logic gates (NOR, NAND, OR, AND) and analog circuits (op-amps).
- [ ] Store these datasets in an organized file structure.

### Model Training
- [ ] Train multiple permutations of different models for each logic gate and analog circuit (e.g., 100+ models per type).
- [ ] Save the trained models and related statistics.
- [ ] Store the training results in a structured way.

### Evaluation of Models
- [ ] Evaluate the performance of the trained models to determine which ones should proceed.
- [ ] Establish evaluation metrics specific to logic gates and analog circuits.
- [ ] Save evaluation results for each model.

### Stress Testing
- [ ] Subject the surviving models from the evaluation step to stress tests.
- [ ] Repeat the evaluation process if multiple models survive stress testing until there's only one left.
- [ ] Save stress testing results for each model.

### Final Model Selection
- [ ] Select the best-performing model based on evaluation and stress test results.
- [ ] Save the final model and its associated statistics.

## Class Implementation
- [ ] Create a generic class template that represents the machine learning models.
- [ ] Implement methods or functions for model generation, training, evaluation, and stress testing.
- [ ] Define necessary parameters within the class.

By following this checklist, you can effectively manage and document the steps in your machine learning pipeline for logic gates and analog circuits classification.
